    <center><h1>Why is Antractica Melting</h1></center>
   <center><h3>
    Since the early 1900s, many glaciers around the world have been rapidly melting. Human activities are at the root of this phenomenon. Specifically, since the industrial revolution, carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions have raised temperatures, even higher in the poles, and as a result, glaciers are rapidly melting, calving off into the sea and retreating on land.

Even if we significantly curb emissions in the coming decades, more than a third of the worldâ€™s remaining glaciers will melt before the year 2100. When it comes to sea ice, 95% of the oldest and thickest ice in the Arctic is already gone.
    <br>
    In short we can say that Antarctica is melting due to global warming.
